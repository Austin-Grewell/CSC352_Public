# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```text
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```

Words can be separated by any number of whitespace characters (` `), commas (`,`), or newline characters (`\n`).

Quotation characters (`"` or `'`) should be ignored along with any characters not considered words (such as `!`, `@`, etc).
